# Contributor License Agreement

## TribeNest Contributor License Agreement

**Version 1.0**

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") is between you (the "Contributor") and TribeNest ("Project") for the purpose of clarifying the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity to the Project.

### 1. Definitions

- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by you to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by you as "Not a Contribution."

- **"Project"** means TribeNest and its maintainers, contributors, and any other person or entity that owns or manages the Work.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby grant to the Project and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against you or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4. Commercial Rights

You acknowledge and agree that the Project retains the right to:

- Use your Contributions in commercial products and services
- Create proprietary hosting platforms and services using your Contributions
- License your Contributions under different terms for commercial use
- Grant sublicenses to third parties for commercial purposes

### 5. Your Rights

You retain the right to:

- Use your Contributions for your own purposes
- License your Contributions under any terms you choose

### 6. Representations

You represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the above license
- If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project
- Your Contributions are your original works of authorship
- Your Contributions do not violate any third-party intellectual property rights

### 7. Disclaimer

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 6, THE CONTRIBUTOR PROVIDES THE CONTRIBUTION "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
